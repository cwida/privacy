-- q08: 64-possible-worlds-semantics using lambda expressions:
-- we calculate the expression sum(nation=='BRAZIL'?volume:0)/SUM(volume) in a list_transform-lambda for all 64 outcomes
-- since that expression contains two aggregates, we list_zip two counters into a list of two values first
-- the inner list_transforms are just to cast the DOUBLE counter values back to their original type
-- the final computed expression is then reduced to a single noised double value using as_noised and cast to the exptected type
