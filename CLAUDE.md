# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Working with the user

When you're stuck — either unable to fix a bug after 2-3 attempts, or tempted to work around the actual problem by redefining the objective — **stop and ask the user for directions**. Explain clearly what the specific problem is (e.g., "pac_clip_sum(UBIGINT, DOUBLE) has no matching overload — should I add a DOUBLE overload or cast?"). The user knows this codebase deeply and can often point you to the right solution in one sentence. Do not silently change the goal, declare something impossible, or add bloated workarounds without consulting first. We work as a team.

Always test your changes with real queries (e.g., TPC-H on sf1) before declaring success, not just unit tests. Unit tests with wide boolean thresholds can pass even when the code is fundamentally broken.

Never execute git commands that could lose code. Always ask the user for permission on those.

## Development rules

- **New features must have tests.** Ask the user whether to create a new test file or extend an existing one in `test/sql/`.
- **Never remove a failing test to "fix" a failure.** If a test fails, fix the underlying bug. Tests exist for a reason.
- **Before implementing anything, search the existing codebase** for similar patterns or solutions. Check if a helper function, utility, or prior approach already addresses the problem. Reuse before reinventing.
- **Use helper functions.** Factor shared logic into helpers rather than duplicating code. Check `src/include/utils/` and existing helpers in the file you're editing.
- **Never edit the `duckdb/` submodule.** The DuckDB source is read-only. All PAC logic lives in `src/` and `test/`. If you need DuckDB internals, use the public API or ask the user.
- **Keep the paper in mind.** The PAC mechanism is described in [SIMD-PAC-DB: Pretty Performant PAC Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.15023). Refer to it for the theoretical foundations (noise calibration, mutual information bounds, counter semantics) before making changes to core aggregate logic.
- **Add `PRIVACY_DEBUG_PRINT` statements** at major code flow points (entry/exit of compilation phases, aggregate rewrites, clipping decisions). Use the existing `PRIVACY_DEBUG_PRINT` macro from `src/include/privacy_debug.hpp` — it's compiled out when `PRIVACY_DEBUG` is 0.

## What is this extension?

`privacy` is a DuckDB extension that automatically privatizes SQL aggregate queries. It supports four privacy mechanisms, selected by the single `SET privacy_mode` setting (the `dp_*` settings tune the chosen mechanism, they do not select it):

- **`pac`** (default): PAC Privacy — empirical MIA resistance. Maintains 64 parallel counters per aggregate (one per "world" bit), adds noise calibrated to the query variance across sub-samples. Provides theoretical mutual-information bounds. Not differential privacy.
- **`dp_standard`**: Global-sensitivity DP — pure ε-DP for **ungrouped** queries, (ε,δ)-DP for **grouped** ones (see partition selection below). Bounds each privacy unit's *total* contribution to a fixed constant (per-PU contribution clipping), so global sensitivity equals that constant — data-independent. On a single PU table this is per-row clipping (COUNT sensitivity = 1, SUM = `dp_sum_bound`); on a join it pre-aggregates per PU (grouping by the PU-adjacent FK), clips each PU's partial to `dp_sum_bound`/`dp_count_bound`, then sums — so a join with COUNT requires `dp_count_bound`. Laplace noise calibrated to `bound/epsilon`. **Grouped queries apply private partition selection by default** (noised `COUNT(DISTINCT pu) ≥ τ`, the same Wilson/Google mechanism as `dp_sass`): the released key set is data-dependent, so this reserves `ε_η = ε/(c+1)` and needs `δ_η`, making grouped `dp_standard` (ε,δ)-DP and **requiring `dp_delta`**; ungrouped `dp_standard` stays pure ε-DP.
- **`dp_elastic`**: Elastic sensitivity DP — formal (ε,δ)-DP **at the row level** (FLEX/Chorus neighbor = change one tuple). Same Laplace pipeline as `dp_standard` but uses per-row clipping and the smoothed join-frequency envelope (`2·SES_β`, β derived from ε,δ) for sensitivity. Requires `dp_delta`. **Not user-level**: `∏mf` bounds a single-tuple change, not a whole PU's contribution — a user-level extension would need per-user statistics and a new sensitivity proof (future work). It follows FLEX's public/enumerated-partition model (no *DP* partition selection), unlike the user-level `dp_standard`/`dp_sass`. Its `privacy_min_group_count` gate is a **raw (un-noised) admin support filter, not DP partition selection** — under FLEX's public-partition assumption it's a utility convenience; making it row-level-DP-safe would need a noised τ with `C_u = 1` (Dandan's row-level branch), deferred.
- **`dp_sass`**: Sample-and-aggregate. Computes 64 sample (lane) aggregates per privacy unit and releases either the **median** (`dp_sass_release='median'`, default; smooth-sensitivity Laplace, (ε,δ)-DP, requires `dp_delta`) or the **mean** (`dp_sass_release='average'`; GUPT-style, pure ε-DP, no `dp_delta`). Per-PU contribution is clipped (`dp_count_bound`/`dp_sum_bound`); the cross-group bound `dp_max_groups_contributed` (C_u) enters each aggregate's budget. **Grouped queries apply private partition selection automatically** (per the paper's Algorithm 2): a noised `COUNT(DISTINCT pu)` is released only when `≥ τ = 1 − C_u·log(2−2(1−δ_η)^{1/C_u})/ε_η`, reserving `ε_η = ε/(c+1)` and `δ_η = δ/(c+1)` so each of the c aggregates gets `ε/((c+1)·C_u)`. Grouped `dp_sass` therefore requires `dp_delta` (the pure-ε `average` release is only valid ungrouped). The released value is clamped to a public output domain (`dp_sass_count_output_bound`, `dp_sass_sum_output_bound`, `dp_sass_avg_lower/upper_bound`, `dp_sass_minmax_lower/upper_bound`); with `dp_sass_private_range=true` (average release only) a fraction `dp_sass_range_budget_fraction` of ε privately estimates that range (pure-ε exp-mechanism quantiles). Supports COUNT, COUNT(DISTINCT), SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX.

`dp_standard` and `dp_elastic` share one code path (`CompileDPLaplaceQuery` in `privacy_mechanisms.cpp`); they differ only in how contributions are clipped and how sensitivity is derived (`ClipAndComputeSensitivities`). All four modes share the same DDL (`PRIVACY_KEY`, `PRIVACY_LINK`, `PROTECTED`) and rewrite aggregate plans transparently — users write normal SQL.

## Build & Test

```bash
GEN=ninja make                # build (release)
make test                     # run all tests (~25 tests, ~2200 assertions)

# single test
build/release/test/unittest "test/sql/pac_sum.test"

# C++ unit tests (parser, traversal, compiler)
build/release/extension/privacy/pac_test_runner
```

Build outputs go to `build/release/`. DuckDB is a git submodule in `duckdb/`.

## Compilation Pipeline

The optimizer hook runs in `pre_optimize_function` — BEFORE DuckDB's built-in optimizers (join order, filter pushdown, column lifetime). This means:
- `plan->ResolveOperatorTypes()` must be called before accessing `LogicalProjection::types` (they're empty in raw plans)
- WHERE filters are still separate FILTER nodes
- LIMIT is a separate root node
- DuckDB's optimizers run automatically on the transformed plan

### PAC pipeline phases (in order)

1. **Compatibility check** (`privacy_compatibility_check.cpp`) — decides if query needs PAC rewrite; rejects unsupported patterns (window functions, protected columns in GROUP BY)
2. **FK join injection** (`pac_bitslice_add_fkjoins.cpp`) — adds missing joins to reach PU tables
3. **Aggregate transformation** (`pac_bitslice_compiler.cpp` → `pac_expression_builder.cpp`) — replaces SUM/COUNT/etc. with pac_noised_sum/pac_noised_count/etc., inserts pac_hash projections above scans
4. **Categorical rewrite** (`pac_categorical_rewriter.cpp`) — when PAC aggregates appear in filters/comparisons, converts to counter lists (LIST\<FLOAT\>) with pac_filter/pac_select terminals
5. **AVG decomposition** (`pac_avg_rewriter.cpp`) — rewrites pac_noised_avg into pac_noised_div(pac_sum, pac_count)
6. **Clip rewrite** (`pac_expression_builder.cpp:RewriteClipAggregates`) — when `pac_clip_support` is set, inserts lower aggregate for per-PU pre-aggregation with clipping

### DP-elastic / DP-standard pipeline phases (in order)

> `dp_standard` and `dp_elastic` run the **same** phases below via `CompileDPLaplaceQuery`, differing only in `ClipAndComputeSensitivities`: `dp_standard` does per-PU contribution clipping (a per-PU pre-aggregation on joins) → sensitivity = the bound (pure ε-DP, no δ); `dp_elastic` does per-row clipping + smooth elastic sensitivity `2·SES_β` ((ε,δ)-DP, needs δ).


1. **Compatibility check** (`privacy_compatibility_check.cpp`) — shared structural checks; PU columns can only appear inside aggregates
2. **FK chain extraction** (`dp_elastic_compiler.cpp:ExtractFKChain`) — validates a linear FK path to the PU; chain may be explicit (joins in the SQL) or implicit (derived from PRIVACY_LINK metadata when the PU table is absent)
3. **AVG rewrite** (`dp_elastic_compiler.cpp:RewriteAvgAggregates`) — each `AVG(x)` is replaced in-place by `SUM(x)` and a `COUNT(*)` is appended; the original `FILTER (WHERE …)` predicate is propagated to both
4. **Clipping** (`dp_elastic_compiler.cpp:ClipSumInputs`) — SUM (and AVG-derived SUM) arguments wrapped in `greatest(least(v, C), -C)` where C = `dp_sum_bound`
5. **Sensitivity computation** (`dp_elastic_compiler.cpp:ComputeMfK` + `ComputeElasticSensitivity`) — per-table max frequency; global ES = ∏ mf; smooth ES with β = ε/(2·ln(2/δ)) when δ > 0
6. **Budget split** (`CompileDPElasticQuery`) — with k user-visible aggregates each gets ε/k (scale × k); AVG components further split to ε/(2k) (scale × 2k)
7. **Noise injection** (`dp_elastic_compiler.cpp:WrapAggregateWithLaplace`) — projection above the aggregate adds `dp_laplace_noise(agg, scale)` per column, cast back to the original type
8. **τ-thresholding** (`dp_elastic_compiler.cpp:ApplyGroupSuppression`) — if `privacy_min_group_count` set, a filter above the noise projection drops groups where `|noised| < threshold · √2 · scale` (skipped for AVG positions, whose ratio is not a simple Laplace output)
9. **AVG ratio projection** (`dp_elastic_compiler.cpp:WrapAvgRatioProjection`) — inserted above the suppression filter (or directly above the noise projection if no suppression). Computes `cast(noised_sum, DOUBLE) / greatest(cast(noised_count, DOUBLE), 1.0)` for each AVG; non-AVG outputs pass through. ColumnBindingReplacer remaps upstream references (including any HAVING filter) so they read the ratio rather than the raw SUM

### Aggregate naming convention

| Name pattern | Returns | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `pac_sum/count/min/max` | LIST\<FLOAT\> | 64 counters (used by categorical/clip rewrites) |
| `pac_noised_sum/count/min/max` | scalar | Fused counters + noise (direct query output) |
| `pac_clip_sum/count/min/max` | LIST\<FLOAT\> | Counters with per-level support clipping |
| `pac_noised_clip_sum/count/min/max` | scalar | Fused clip + noise |

pac_noised_* is the fused version of pac_noised(pac_*()). The unfused form is used when expressions operate on counters (list_transform/lambdas in categorical queries).

### Key architectural rules

- **pac_hash is always computed in a Projection above the scan**, never inside an aggregate
- **Pre-computed bindings become stale after RewriteBottomUp** — always re-compute at point of use
- **Use `binder.GenerateTableIndex()`** for new table indices, never manual tracking
- **Always call `ResolveOperatorTypes()`** after creating or modifying a LogicalAggregate
- **pac_noised_sum on DECIMAL** uses `BindDecimalPacSum` to dispatch by physical type and set return_type to DECIMAL(38, scale) — any new sum variant needs the same pattern

```

## Code style (clang-tidy)

The project uses clang-tidy with DuckDB's configuration (`.clang-tidy`). Key naming rules:

- **Classes/Enums**: `CamelCase` (e.g., `PacClipSumIntState`)
- **Functions**: `CamelCase` (e.g., `GetLevel`, `AllocateLevel`)
- **Variables/parameters/members**: `lower_case` (e.g., `max_level_used`, `key_hash`)
- **Constants/static/constexpr**: `UPPER_CASE` (e.g., `PAC2_NUM_LEVELS`, `PAC2_LEVEL_SHIFT`)
- **Macros**: `UPPER_CASE` (e.g., `PRIVACY_DEBUG_PRINT`)
- **Typedefs**: `lower_case_t` suffix (e.g., `aggregate_update_t`)

Other style rules (from `.clang-format`, based on LLVM):

- **Tabs for indentation**, width 4
- **Column limit**: 120
- **Braces**: same line as statement (K&R / Allman-attached)
- **Pointers**: right-aligned (`int *ptr`, not `int* ptr`)
- **No short functions on single line**
- **Templates**: always break after `template<...>`
- **Long arguments**: align after open bracket

Run `make format-fix` to auto-format. Formatting runs automatically via hook after edits.
