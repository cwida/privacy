/**
 * PropagateSingleBinding: Propagates a single column binding through intermediate operators
 * from a source operator to a target aggregate.
 *
 * This is the core propagation function. It traces the path from the target aggregate
 * down to the source operator (identified by source_table_index), and ensures the column
 * identified by source_binding passes through all intermediate operators (projections,
 * joins, filters) by adding it where needed.
 *
 * Returns the final ColumnBinding as seen from the aggregate's direct child.
 * Returns {INVALID_INDEX, INVALID_INDEX} if propagation fails (no path, blocked by semi/anti join).
