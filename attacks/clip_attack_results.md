# pac_clip_sum Attack Evaluation

Evaluates whether `pac_clip_sum`'s support-based outlier attenuation defeats the
variance side-channel membership inference attack (MIA).

## Background

`pac_clip_sum` (commit 948a504) introduces a two-level aggregation:

1. **Lower aggregate**: `GROUP BY pu_hash` with plain `SUM` — pre-aggregates per user
2. **Upper aggregate**: `pac_noised_clip_sum` — decomposes values into magnitude levels
   (each 16x the previous), tracks a 64-bit bitmap of distinct contributors per level,
   and attenuates levels with fewer contributors than `pac_clip_support`

Supported clip aggregates: SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX (MIN/MAX not fully implemented).
float/double types not yet supported.

## Parameters

- `pac_mi = 0.0078125` (1/128)
- 30 trials per condition unless noted
- Random guess baseline: 50%

## Attack 1: Single-query variance classifier (small filter)

**Setup**: N=1000 users, target=999999, filter<=3 (3-4 users in aggregation)

| clip_support | Var>200k accuracy | Standard accuracy | std_in | std_out | std ratio |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| off | **96.0%** | 80.0% | 10,688,008 | 117,662 | 90.8x |
| 2 | **72.5%** | 62.7% | 613,511 | 122,026 | 5.0x |
| 3 | **72.5%** | 62.7% | 613,511 | 122,026 | 5.0x |

**Finding**: Clipping reduces attack accuracy from 96% to 72.5% and collapses the
variance ratio from 91x to 5x. The outlier's contribution is attenuated by ~16x
(one magnitude level). However, 72.5% is still well above random — the residual
5x variance gap remains exploitable.

clip=2 and clip=3 produce identical results because with only 3-4 users per level,
the bitmap support is at most 2-3 regardless of threshold.

---

## Attack 2: Wide filter (clipping best-case)

**Setup**: N=1000 users, target=999999, filter<=999 (all users in aggregation)

| clip_support | Var>200k accuracy | Standard accuracy | std_in | std_out | std ratio |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| off | 53.3% | 60.0% | 10,424,631 | 1,822,936 | 5.7x |
| 2 | **55.0%** | 53.3% | 1,816,604 | 1,875,047 | **1.0x** |
| 5 | **55.0%** | 53.3% | 1,816,604 | 1,875,047 | **1.0x** |
| 10 | **55.0%** | 53.3% | 1,816,604 | 1,875,047 | **1.0x** |

**Finding**: With many users in the aggregation, clipping completely eliminates the
variance side-channel (std ratio goes to 1.0x). Attack accuracy drops to ~53-55%, near
random. The outlier's magnitude level has only 1 bitmap contributor vs hundreds at
normal levels — it is cleanly identified and attenuated.

Note: even without clipping, the attack barely works (53%) because the outlier
signal (1M) is diluted by the large background (5M from 999 users). Clipping
further equalizes the means (5.1M vs 4.9M).

clip=2, 5, and 10 all produce identical results — with ~1000 users, all normal
levels have saturated bitmaps (est. distinct >> 10), so only the outlier level
is affected.

---

## Attack 3: 10K users, extreme outlier

**Setup**: N=10000 users, target=9,999,999, filter<=2 (2-3 users in aggregation)

| clip_support | Var>200k accuracy | Standard accuracy | std_in | std_out | std ratio |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| off | **97.8%** | 77.8% | 104,410,859 | 110,259 | 947x |
| 2 | **75.0%** | 47.9% | 396,383 | 112,778 | 3.5x |
| 3 | **47.9%** | 47.9% | 0 | 0 | — |

**Finding**: clip=2 reduces accuracy from 97.8% to 75% (variance ratio 947x to 3.5x).
clip=3 zeroes ALL results (returns 0 for both in and out) — with only 2-3 users,
no level reaches 3 distinct contributors, so everything is zeroed. The attack is
"defeated" at 47.9% but utility is completely destroyed.

---

## Attack 4: Over-clipping

**Setup**: N=1000 users, target=999999, filter<=3, 15 trials

| clip_support | Var>200k accuracy | mean_in | mean_out |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|----------|
| off | 91.3% | -2,067,562 | 42,892 |
| 5 | **50.0%** | 0 | 0 |
| 10 | **50.0%** | 0 | 0 |

**Finding**: With only 3-4 users in the filter, clip_support >= 5 zeroes all output.
Attack accuracy = 50% (random), but every query returns 0. This is not a useful
defense — it's equivalent to refusing to answer.

**Takeaway**: `pac_clip_support` must be set below the minimum expected number of
users in any aggregation group. For small filters, this severely limits the
clipping threshold.

---

## Attack 5: Wide filter + aggressive clipping

**Setup**: N=1000 users, target=999999, filter<=999, 15 trials

| clip_support | Var>200k accuracy | Standard accuracy | std_in | std_out |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|---------|
| off | 53.3% | 63.3% | 11,391,246 | 2,172,216 |
| 50 | **50.0%** | 50.0% | 1,219,189 | 2,049,795 |
| 100 | **50.0%** | 50.0% | 1,219,189 | 2,049,795 |

**Finding**: With a wide filter (1000 users), even aggressive clipping (support=50, 100)
works perfectly — attack accuracy = 50% (random) and noise stds are equalized.
Normal magnitude levels have hundreds of bitmap contributors, far exceeding the
threshold. Only the outlier level (1 contributor) is affected.

---

## Attack 6: Clip-after-filter vs clip-full-table

The concern is that clipping applied after filtering may leak more than clipping
applied to the entire dataset, because the filter changes which users contribute
to the bitmap, affecting which levels appear "supported."

**Setup**: N=1000 users, target=999999, filter<=3

| Method | Var>200k accuracy | std_in | std_out | std ratio |
|--------|-------------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| No clipping | **96.0%** | 10,688,008 | 117,662 | 90.8x |
| clip-after-filter (pac_clip_support=2) | **72.5%** | 613,511 | 122,026 | 5.0x |
| clip-full-table (pre-clip to mu+3sigma) | **56.9%** | 180,457 | 124,641 | 1.4x |

**Finding: the concern is valid.** Pre-clipping the full table then filtering gives
significantly better protection (56.9% vs 72.5%). The reasons:

1. **Full-table pre-clipping** clamps the billionaire to 13,661 BEFORE PAC sees it.
   PAC computes noise from the clamped range [1, 13661], and the noise is nearly
   the same for in/out (std ratio 1.4x).

2. **Clip-after-filter** only sees 3-4 rows. The bitmap has very few bits set per
   level, making it harder to distinguish the outlier level from normal levels.
   The attenuation is only ~16x (one level), leaving a 5x variance gap.

However, clip-after-filter is still much better than no clipping (72.5% vs 96%),
confirming the second point: "this approach is still significantly better
than not applying clipping at all."

## Summary

| Scenario | No clip | pac_clip_support=2 | Pre-clip full table |
|----------|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Small filter (3-4 users) | 96% | 72.5% | 56.9% |
| Wide filter (1000 users) | 53% | 55% (side-channel gone) | — |
| 10K users, filter<=2 | 97.8% | 75% | — |

## Attack 7: 20K small items user (multi-row outlier)

The core argument for per-user pre-aggregation: a user with 20,000 purchases of
$50 each has normal individual values but a total contribution of $1,000,000.
Per-row Winsorization won't catch this. Does pac_clip_sum's GROUP BY pu_hash?

**Setup**: N=1000 background users (1 row each, acctbal in [1,10000]).
Target user_id=0: 20,000 rows x $50 = $1,000,000 total. filter<=3.

| Method | Var>200k accuracy | std_in | std_out | std ratio |
|--------|-------------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| No clipping | **96.0%** | 10,686,722 | 117,662 | 90.8x |
| Winsorization (per-row clip to 13661) | **94.1%** | 9,436,439 | 124,641 | 75.7x |
| pac_clip_sum (clip_support=2) | **72.5%** | 613,511 | 122,026 | 5.0x |

**Finding: Winsorization completely fails.** Each $50 value is well within the
[0, 13661] clip bounds, so nothing gets clipped. The 20,000 small rows pass
through untouched and the attack succeeds at 94.1% (barely below the 96% baseline).

**pac_clip_sum catches it** because the pre-aggregation step (`GROUP BY pu_hash`)
sums user_id=0's 20,000 rows into a single $1,000,000 entry. This lands at an
outlier magnitude level with only 1 bitmap contributor, and gets attenuated.
Attack accuracy drops to 72.5%.

This is precisely Peter's argument for why per-user contribution clipping (via
pre-aggregation) is needed instead of per-row value clipping. It validates the
two-level aggregation design from Wilson et al. 2019.

## Suffix attenuation modes compared

We tested three suffix attenuation strategies for unsupported outlier levels.
"Soft-clamp" is Peter's original (scale by 16^distance). "Bitmap-proportional"
adds a factor of estimated_distinct/threshold. "Hard-zero" skips the level entirely.

**Attack 1 results (N=1000, filter<=3, clip=2):**

| Mode | Var>200k | std_in | std_out | std ratio |
|------|----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| No clipping | **96.0%** | 10,688,008 | 117,662 | 90.8x |
| Soft-clamp | **72.5%** | 613,511 | 122,026 | 5.0x |
| Bitmap-proportional | **66.7%** | 327,625 | 122,026 | 2.7x |
| **Hard zero** | **47.1%** | 106,223 | 122,026 | **0.87x** |

## Hard-zero stress tests

Comprehensive adversarial evaluation of the hard-zero mode.

### TEST 1: High trial count (60 trials, best-threshold search)

| truth | mean | std | n |
|-------|------|-----|---|
| in | 12,397 | 87,366 | 49 |
| out | 29,758 | 109,140 | 54 |

Best threshold accuracy (searched 10k-500k in 10k steps): **52.4%**.
Midpoint classifier: **52.4%**. Likelihood ratio: **52.4%**.
All classifiers are indistinguishable from random.

### TEST 2: Composed queries (30 trials x 10 queries)

| n_queries | accuracy |
|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 43.4% |
| 5 | 50.9% |
| 10 | 48.1% |
| Majority vote | **50.0%** |

Per-trial variance: in_std=83,747, out_std=85,116, **ratio=0.98**.
Composing 10 queries and averaging does not help the attacker.

### TEST 3: Moderate outlier (target=50,000, same magnitude level as normal)

**THIS BREAKS IT.** Target 50,000 is in level 2 (4096-65535), same as normal users.
The bitmap shows this level as supported → no clipping occurs.

| truth | mean | std |
|-------|------|-----|
| in | 139,946 | 497,518 |
| out | 20,093 | 122,026 |

Best threshold accuracy: **76.5%**. Std ratio: 4.1x.

**Implication**: pac_clip_sum only clips outliers that are at a DIFFERENT magnitude
level than normal users. A 10x outlier within the same level passes through.

### TEST 4: Two colluding outliers

Two users with 999,999 — level 3 has 2 bitmap bits, meeting threshold=2.

| truth | mean | std |
|-------|------|-----|
| in | 1,783,465 | 12,547,986 |
| out | 20,093 | 122,026 |

Best threshold accuracy: **100.0%**. Attack fully succeeds.

**Implication**: Two colluding users at the same magnitude level make that level
"supported." The clipping mechanism assumes outlier levels have few contributors.
Collusion (or any scenario with 2+ users at the same extreme level) defeats it.

### TEST 5: Filter probing

Attacker uses two queries with different filters to probe clipping behavior.

| Query | Best accuracy |
|-------|--------------|
| Filter<=3 (narrow) | 52.9% |
| Filter<=999 (wide) | 51.7% |
| Cross-filter differential | **51.0%** |

**The filter-probing concern is NOT exploitable with hard-zero.** The narrow query zeroes the
outlier level, giving identical counter distributions for in/out. The wide query
has the outlier's level zeroed too (1 contributor < threshold). The cross-filter
differential reveals nothing.

### TEST 6: 20K small items ($50 x 20,000)

Best threshold accuracy: **52.9%**. Attack defeated.
Pre-aggregation collapses 20K rows into one $1M entry at level 3, which is zeroed.

### TEST 7: Borderline outlier (target=65,536, exactly level 3 boundary)

Best threshold accuracy: **52.9%**. Attack defeated.
Even the minimum level-3 value is zeroed when it's the sole contributor.

---

### Key takeaways

1. **Hard-zero fully defeats the variance side-channel** for outliers at unsupported
   magnitude levels. Attack accuracy = 50% across all classifiers, even with
   composed queries, different thresholds, and cross-filter probing.

2. **Moderate outliers within the same magnitude level are NOT caught.** A 10x outlier
   (50,000 vs normal ~5,000) sits in the same level and passes through unclipped.
   Attack accuracy: 76.5%. This is a fundamental limitation of the magnitude-level
   granularity (each level spans 16x).

3. **Two colluding outliers defeat the clipping** by making their level "supported"
   (2 contributors >= threshold 2). Attack accuracy: 100%.

4. **Filter probing does not apply with hard-zero.** The zeroed level
   contributes nothing regardless of filter, so different filters reveal no info.

5. **The pre-aggregation step remains essential** — 20K small items are correctly
   collapsed and clipped.

## pac_clip_scale comparison (2026-04-02)

Tests `pac_clip_scale = true` (scale unsupported outlier levels to nearest supported
level) vs `false` (hard-zero / omit). Peter's hypothesis: scaling should be safe
because outliers become a minority in the already-supported bucket.

Code version: after Peter's refactoring into `pac_clip_aggr.hpp`, CLIP_LEVEL_SHIFT=2
(4x per level, was 16x previously).

### Setup

- N=1000 background users, acctbal ∈ [1, 10000]
- pac_mi = 0.0078125 (1/128), 30 trials per condition
- Background sum: filter<=3 = 18,347; filter<=999 = 4,871,091

### Small filter results (filter<=3, clip_support=2)

| Test | Outlier | scale=false best% | scale=true best% | scale=false std_in | scale=true std_in | std_out |
|------|---------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Extreme | tv=999,999 | **55.6%** | **64.8%** | 94,882 | 169,449 | 107,976 |
| Moderate | tv=50,000 | **55.6%** | **61.1%** | 94,882 | 147,406 | 107,976 |
| Multi-row | 20K×$50 | **55.6%** | **64.8%** | 94,882 | 169,449 | 107,976 |
| Borderline | tv=65,536 | **55.6%** | **57.4%** | 94,882 | 104,640 | 107,976 |

With **hard-zero** (scale=false): all outlier contributions are completely zeroed. The
"in" distribution is identical to "out" — attack accuracy ~55% (random). No side-channel.

With **scaling** (scale=true): outlier values are scaled down to the nearest supported
level. This creates a mild variance side-channel (std ratio ~1.57x). Attack accuracy
rises to 57-65% — measurable but not catastrophic.

### Small filter results (clip_support=10 and 50)

All conditions return 0 for both in/out (no level reaches 10 or 50 distinct
contributors with only 3-4 users). Scale mode is irrelevant — both modes identical.

### Wide filter results (filter<=999, clip_support=2)

| clip | scale | mean_in | std_in | mean_out | std_out | best% |
|------|-------|---------|--------|----------|---------|-------|
| 2 | false | 4,737,114 | 1,516,576 | 4,973,475 | 1,642,654 | 53.3% |
| 2 | true | 4,750,242 | 1,538,381 | 4,973,475 | 1,642,654 | 53.3% |
| 50 | false | 4,734,354 | 1,516,680 | 4,970,423 | 1,643,039 | 53.3% |
| 50 | true | 4,791,594 | 1,539,287 | 5,019,631 | 1,639,877 | 55.0% |

No meaningful difference. Both modes near random with wide filters.

### Key findings

1. **Peter is partially right**: scaling does NOT cause a variance explosion. The leak
   is moderate (~10 percentage points above random at worst), not catastrophic.
   His intuition that scaled values become a minority in the supported bucket holds.

2. **Hard-zero is still strictly better for privacy**: it produces zero information
   leakage in all tested scenarios. Scaling leaks mildly.

3. **Major improvement from 4x granularity**: the moderate outlier (tv=50,000) that
   previously defeated clipping at 76.5% accuracy (when levels were 16x wide, both
   5000 and 50000 in same level) is now caught by both modes (~55-61%). The shift
   from CLIP_LEVEL_SHIFT=4 (16x) to CLIP_LEVEL_SHIFT=2 (4x) dramatically improved
   detection of moderate outliers.

4. **Recommendation**: keep hard-zero as default (no leakage), but scaling is a
   reasonable option where utility matters more. The ~10pp accuracy gap may be
   acceptable in many threat models.
