# DP mechanisms — implementation reference

Implementation reference for the extension's three **differential-privacy** modes
(`dp_standard`, `dp_elastic`, `dp_sass`), selected via `SET privacy_mode = '…'`, and
their correspondence to the SIMD-ASA paper and the DP literature. Source references
are given as `file — Function`.

## 1. Overview & threat model

A **privacy unit (PU)** is the entity we protect — one PU = one row of a table
declared `SET PU` (identified by its `PRIVACY_KEY`) plus every row that links to it
through `PRIVACY_LINK` foreign keys. Two databases are **neighbors** when they
differ by one PU (user-level) or by one tuple (row-level); see §6.

All three DP modes rewrite a normal SQL aggregate query, transparently, into a plan
that (i) bounds each unit's contribution, (ii) adds calibrated noise, and (iii) for
grouped queries decides which group keys may be released. They differ in how
sensitivity is derived and in the neighbor relation they protect:

| mode | guarantee | level | sensitivity | partitions | basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dp_standard` | pure ε (ungrouped) / (ε,δ) (grouped) | **user** | global (per-PU contribution clipped to a constant) | private by default | Google DP (Wilson et al. 2020) |
| `dp_elastic`  | (ε,δ) | **row** | smooth elastic sensitivity `2·SES_β` over join max-frequencies | public / enumerated (FLEX) | FLEX (Johnson, Near & Song 2018) |
| `dp_sass`     | median: (ε,δ) always; mean: pure ε (ungrouped) / (ε,δ) (grouped) | **user** | smooth sensitivity of the per-lane median | private by default | smooth-sensitivity sample-and-aggregate over SIMD aggregates (SIMD-SAA^udp) |

For `dp_sass` the guarantee depends on **both** the release rule and grouping. The
**median** release is (ε,δ)-DP for grouped and ungrouped queries alike. The **mean**
(GUPT) release mirrors `dp_standard`: pure ε-DP when ungrouped, but (ε,δ)-DP when
grouped, because grouping triggers private partition selection (§7), which needs a
non-zero δ.

---

## 2. Mapping to the paper and literature

- **`dp_sass`** is our implementation of smooth-sensitivity DP over a sample-and-aggregate
  decomposition built on the SIMD stochastic aggregates. It realises **Algorithm 2
  (SIMD-SAA^udp compiler)**, the `ss_noised` subroutine, and **Theorem 4.1** (user-level
  (ε,δ)-DP) from the SIMD-ASA paper. §11 walks the algorithm line by line.
- **`dp_standard`** is **Google DP** — the bounded-user-contribution SQL mechanism of
  *Wilson et al., "Differentially Private SQL with Bounded User Contribution"* (PoPETs
  2020). It is not in this paper; it is the standard global-sensitivity baseline.
- **`dp_elastic`** is **FLEX** — *Johnson, Near & Song, "Towards Practical Differential
  Privacy for SQL Queries"* (VLDB 2018), the paper's reference [21]. Treated as a
  **row-level** baseline exactly as Google DP treats FLEX in its comparison.

Compiler entry points: `src/compiler/privacy_mechanisms.cpp` —
`CompileDPStandardQuery`, `CompileDPElasticQuery` (both call `CompileDPLaplaceQuery`),
and `CompileDPSampleMedianQuery`.

---

## 3. The DP checker and rejected queries

A **foreign-key (FK) path** is the chain of join edges that connects a table
referenced in the query to the PU table, following the `PRIVACY_LINK` foreign keys
declared in the schema (e.g. `lineitem → orders → customer`, where `customer` is the
PU). The path is **linear** when it is a simple chain of one-to-many joins with no
branching, so that every tuple maps to exactly one PU. This is what lets the compiler
attribute each contribution to a single privacy unit.

Before any rewrite, a shared structural check runs
(`src/metadata/privacy_compatibility_check.cpp`, and `CheckDPAggregates` /
`CheckDPAggregateNode` in `privacy_mechanisms.cpp`). It accepts a single aggregation
over such a linear FK path to the PU and rejects everything it cannot analyse, failing
loudly rather than releasing something unproven:

- **More than one aggregate node** (i.e. an aggregate over another aggregate's output
  — nested/`E`-type queries). This matches the restriction in the SIMD-ASA paper: the
  `T^udp` query class **excludes the expression type `E`** (aggregate-in-predicate /
  categorical). Such queries are rejected, not silently mishandled.
- **Protected columns in `GROUP BY` or `HAVING`** (a protected value would drive the
  released key set / a post-aggregation filter).
- **Unsupported aggregate functions.** `dp_standard` and `dp_sass` support `COUNT`,
  `COUNT(DISTINCT)`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` (`allow_min_max`). `dp_elastic` supports
  all but `MIN`/`MAX` (elastic sensitivity is defined only for counting queries).
- **`FILTER` on `COUNT(DISTINCT)`** (filtered distinct is not analysed).
- **Window functions, recursive CTEs, and (for DP) CTEs / some correlated subqueries.**
- **Missing required parameters** — e.g. `dp_sum_bound` for `SUM`, `dp_count_bound`
  for `COUNT` over a join, `dp_max_groups_contributed` for a grouped join, and
  `dp_delta` for any query that needs it (§7).
- **Self-joins** beyond the supported factor are rejected (`ValidateDPSelfJoins`).

### Recommended settings for benchmarks

We report benchmarks at **`ε = 0.5`** and **`δ = 1/N_PU`** (one over the number of
privacy units). `δ = 1/N_PU` is the usual "cryptographically small relative to the
population" choice. Note this treats `N_PU` as a **public** quantity — see Open
Questions (§16): `δ` must be a fixed public parameter, so `1/N_PU` should be derived
from a *public estimate* of the dataset scale, never from the exact private PU count.

---

## 5. Assumptions

1. **PU identification.** Each PU is uniquely identified by its `PRIVACY_KEY`
   (one row per PU in the PU table). The `C_u = 1` used for single-table grouped
   queries relies on this (a non-unique key spanning groups would need `C_u > 1`).
2. **Public output domains.** All `dp_sass_*_bound` / `dp_sum_bound` / `dp_count_bound`
   values are admin-set, data-independent public constants.
3. **Elastic uses public/enumerated partitions.** `dp_elastic` follows FLEX's model
   in which the analyst enumerates the `GROUP BY` keys; it does not do DP partition
   selection (§10).
4. **Empty-lane fill is public.** The value used to fill empty sample lanes (§14) is a
   per-aggregate-kind constant derived from the public output domain, never from data.
5. **`sample_lanes` bounds per-PU spread.** `dp_sample_lanes` is the maximum number of
   lanes one PU can occupy; the noise scales use this (§11, §12).
6. **Unannotated tables are public (fail-open).** A joined table with no
   `PRIVACY_KEY`/`PRIVACY_LINK`/protected columns is treated as a public side input
   (`is_public_side_table`, `privacy_mechanisms.cpp`) — this requires the analyst to
   annotate *every* private table; an unannotated private table gets no protection.
7. **`N_PU` public** if `δ = 1/N_PU` is used (§16).

---

## 6. User-level vs row-level

- **User-level** (neighbor = add/remove *all* rows of one PU): `dp_standard` and
  `dp_sass`. Each PU's *total* contribution is bounded (clipping + `C_u`), so the
  guarantee is about entities, not tuples.
- **Row-level** (neighbor = change one tuple): `dp_elastic`. FLEX's elastic sensitivity
  `∏(max-frequency along the join chain)` bounds a **single-tuple** change, not a whole
  PU's contribution, so `dp_elastic` protects tuples, not entities. Extending FLEX to
  user-level would need additional per-user statistics (e.g. max rows one user
  contributes per table) and a new sensitivity analysis + proof — **future work** (§16).

---

## 7. Public vs private partitions and τ-thresholding

For a `GROUP BY` query the **set of released group keys** is itself an output, and it
can leak membership: a key backed by a single unit disappears when that unit is
removed.

- **Private partitions** (the key set is data-dependent): the release/suppress
  decision must be privatised. We follow Google DP / Wilson et al.: release a group
  only when its **noised** count of contributing units clears τ. This costs a
  `δ_η` slice (which cannot be zero), so the query is **(ε,δ)-DP**.
- **Public partitions** (the key set is fixed/enumerated, data-independent): releasing
  all keys leaks nothing, so no thresholding is needed and the key set stays pure-ε.

**Mechanism (paper Algorithm 2, lines 3–10; `FinalizeDPLaplace` and
`CompileDPSampleMedianQuery`).** The auxiliary count is `η = COUNT(DISTINCT pu)` per
group. We reserve a threshold budget `(ε_η, δ_η) = (ε/(c+1), δ/(c+1))` for `c`
user aggregates, add `Laplace(C_u/ε_η)` noise to `η`, and release the group only
when the noised `η' ≥ τ`, with

```
τ = 1 − C_u · log(2 − 2·(1 − δ_η)^(1/C_u)) / ε_η          (Wilson/Google; paper line 9)
```

`C_u = dp_max_groups_contributed`. τ ∈ [1, ∞): tiny `δ_η` → τ = ∞ → all groups
suppressed (graceful, no crash).

**Per-mode stance:** `dp_sass` and `dp_standard` do this **automatically for every
grouped query** (private by default), so grouped queries in those modes require
`dp_delta` and are (ε,δ). `dp_elastic` is the FLEX baseline and does **not** do DP
partition selection (§10).

---

## 8. Contribution bounding and what we estimate

**Bounding (all modes).** Per-PU value contribution is clipped to the public domain
(`greatest(least(v, Λ), L)`), and one PU is capped to `C_u` output groups so the cap
enters the guarantee rather than merely filtering rows. On a join, `dp_standard` first
**pre-aggregates per PU** (`InsertPuPreAggregation`, grouping by the PU-adjacent FK) and
clips each PU's partial; `dp_elastic` clips per row instead.

**How `C_u` is enforced (low level).** After per-PU pre-aggregation each input row is
one `(PU, group)` partial. `ApplyMaxGroupsContributed` wraps that stream in a single
`LogicalWindow` + `LogicalFilter` (`BuildRankCapFilter`): a `ROW_NUMBER()` **partitioned
by the PU key** and **ordered by `hash(PU, group columns)`**, keeping only rows with
`row_number ≤ C_u`. Ordering by a hash makes the retained subset a deterministic,
data-independent per-PU sample of at most `C_u` groups (not "the first `C_u` by value").
`ROW_NUMBER` compiles to a per-partition top-K of capacity `C_u`, so `C_u` must stay
small. `COUNT(DISTINCT)` uses the same primitive but with **two** stacked caps instead
of one (see §13): a `DENSE_RANK` over the group columns capped at `C_u` (at most `C_u`
groups per PU) and a `ROW_NUMBER` over the distinct value capped at `dp_count_bound`
(at most `dp_count_bound` distinct values per `(PU, group)`) — the same factored
clipping `dp_standard` uses, which avoids one giant `C_u·dp_count_bound` top-K.

**What is estimated vs. public.**
- `dp_standard`: **nothing data-dependent** — sensitivity is the public bound times
  `C_u` (global sensitivity).
- `dp_elastic`: the **max-frequency `mf`** of each join key in each table
  (`ComputeMfK`) is read from the data; the elastic sensitivity is `∏ mf` along the
  chain (§10).
- `dp_sass`: sensitivity is estimated from the released sample answers themselves
  (smooth sensitivity, §12).
- All **output-domain bounds are public** (admin-set), never estimated.

---

## 9. `dp_standard` — global sensitivity (Google DP)

`ClipAndComputeSensitivities → ApplyPerPuClipping`. Each PU's total contribution is
clipped to a fixed constant, so global sensitivity equals that constant
(data-independent, so ungrouped `dp_standard` needs no δ):

- single PU table: per-row clip — `COUNT` sensitivity 1, `SUM` = `dp_sum_bound`;
- join: pre-aggregate per PU, clip the partial to `dp_sum_bound` / `dp_count_bound`,
  then `SUM` the clipped partials — so a join with `COUNT` requires `dp_count_bound`;
- `MIN`/`MAX`: clip the value (single table) or the per-PU partial (join) to the public
  domain `[dp_minmax_lower_bound, dp_minmax_upper_bound]`, keep the top aggregate as
  `MIN`/`MAX`, sensitivity = the range `U−L`; the noised output is clamped back into the
  domain (free post-processing);
- grouped: the vector sensitivity is multiplied by `C_u` (`sens = bound · C_u`).

Noise is `Laplace(sens / ε_value)`. For grouped queries, partition selection (§7)
applies and `dp_delta` is required, making grouped `dp_standard` (ε,δ)-DP; ungrouped
stays pure ε-DP. This is Google DP's bounded-user-contribution mechanism.

---

## 10. `dp_elastic` — FLEX (row-level)

`ClipAndComputeSensitivities` (elastic branch) → per-row clip + `ComputeElasticSensitivity`.
Elastic sensitivity is a per-query local-sensitivity upper bound for equijoins: walk
the FK chain, take each table's max join-frequency `mf`, and multiply. The
**smooth** version (δ > 0) decays the distance-`k` envelope:

```
SES_β = max_{k ≥ 0} [ ∏_i (mf_i + k) · e^(−βk) ],   β = ε / (2·ln(2/δ))
```

`ComputeSmoothElasticSensitivity` searches the FLEX window `k ∈ [0, n/β + margin]`
(no fixed ceiling — a fixed cap would under-noise for small ε/δ; it refuses if the
window exceeds 1e9). Noise is `Laplace(2·SES_β / ε)`, giving (ε,δ)-DP at the **row
level** (see §6).

`dp_elastic` follows FLEX's public/enumerated-partition model — it does **no DP
partition selection**. Its `privacy_min_group_count` setting is a **raw, un-noised
admin support filter**, not DP: under the public-partition assumption it is a utility
convenience; a row-level-DP-safe version would need a noised τ with `C_u = 1`
(deferred, since `dp_elastic` is the FLEX baseline). References: FLEX (Johnson, Near &
Song 2018) and its follow-up Chorus.

---

## 11. `dp_sass` — smooth-sensitivity sample-and-aggregate over SIMD aggregates (SIMD-SAA^udp)

`CompileDPSampleMedianQuery`. This realises Algorithm 2. Each PU is hashed into sample
**lanes**; per lane we compute the aggregate on that subsample, then release either the
**median** of the lane answers (smooth-sensitivity Laplace, (ε,δ)) or their **mean**
(GUPT-style, pure ε).

> **Two "lanes" to keep apart.** There are always **`m = 64` lanes** (fixed) — the
> release is the median/mean over these 64. The setting **`dp_sample_lanes`** (default
> `1`) is *not* this count; it is how many of the 64 lanes each **PU** is placed into
> (its per-PU spread). The name is misleading: `dp_sample_lanes = 1` still means 64
> lanes, each PU in one of them.

**Membership function (paper's `H(pu) mod m`).** With `dp_sample_lanes = 1` (the
default) each PU is assigned to exactly one lane by a stable hash of its PU key —
disjoint subsamples, as GUPT/the paper assume. The hash is computed after ordinary
filters have been pushed to scans, and it is a pure function of the PU key, so
adding/removing one PU does not renumber any other PU's sample lane.

> **Note — lanes are not disjoint when `dp_sample_lanes > 1`.** For `sample_lanes > 1`
> a PU is hashed into up to `sample_lanes` lanes by `DpSampleHash`
> (`sample_hash |= 1 << ((key_hash >> 6i) & 63)`), so the subsamples **overlap** — a
> PU appears in several lanes, and there is currently **no mechanism to force the
> subsets to be disjoint** (disjointness is the `sample_lanes = 1` case; two 6-bit
> chunks can even collide onto the same lane). The DP
> guarantee still holds because the noise scales already charge the overlap
> (`Laplace(sample_lanes·(U−L)/m)` for the mean, `beta_eff = β/sample_lanes` for the
> median — §12), but the disjoint-subsample assumption the SAA analysis relies on is
> not enforced for `sample_lanes > 1`.

**`ss_noised` (median release; paper's subroutine).** Sort the 64 clipped lane
answers, take `z_p` with `p = ⌈m/2⌉ = 32` (`values[31]`), compute the smooth
sensitivity `S*` of the median (§12), and add `Laplace(2·S*/ε')` with
`β = ε'/(2·ln(2/δ'))`. Cross-checked against Nissim–Raskhodnikova–Smith (2007).

**Budget (paper lines 4–6).** For `c` user aggregates, reserve `(ε_η, δ_η)` for the
partition-selection count and give each aggregate cell
`ε' = ε/((c+1)·C_u)`, `δ' = δ/((c+1)·C_u)`.

**Contribution bounding (paper line 2).** `ApplyMaxGroupsContributed` keeps at most
`C_u` (pu, group) pairs per PU; per-PU value contribution is clipped to the public
`[L, Λ]` domain.

**Releases.** `dp_sass_release='median'` → smooth-sensitivity Laplace, (ε,δ), needs
`dp_delta`. `dp_sass_release='average'` → **GUPT** mean (Mohan et al. 2012):
`mean = (Σ lanes)/m` + `Laplace(sample_lanes·(Λ−L)/(m·ε))`, pure ε, no δ — valid
**ungrouped** (grouped needs δ for partition selection).

**Partition selection** is automatic for grouped queries (§7).

---

## 12. Smooth sensitivity — the two computations

**Median (`dp_sass`).** Two code paths, in `src/aggregates/dp_laplace_noise.cpp`:
- **Exact** — `SmoothMedianSensitivityExact`: the Nissim–Raskhodnikova–Smith
  divide-and-conquer (`JList`) over the 64 sorted values bracketed by `[L, Λ]`
  sentinels, `O(m log m)`. Used on the bounded path (always, in practice).
- **Approximate** — `SmoothMedianSensitivity`: a capped scan, used only on the legacy
  unbounded path.

For `sample_lanes > 1` the envelope is reweighted with `beta_eff = β / sample_lanes`.
This is (a) β-smooth in PU distance and (b) a **conservative upper bound** on the true
PU-level smooth sensitivity (the PU terms are the `k = sample_lanes·d` subset of the
element-level max, and maxing over all `k` only grows it), so it over-noises if
anything. Full derivation: `SmoothMedianSensitivityExact` in
`src/aggregates/dp_laplace_noise.cpp`.

**Elastic (`dp_elastic`).** `ComputeSmoothElasticSensitivity` — the FLEX
`max_k ∏(mf_i+k)·e^(−βk)` search described in §10. Different object from the median
smooth sensitivity, same NRS `β`.

---

## 13. Per-aggregate handling

| aggregate | `dp_standard` / `dp_elastic` | `dp_sass` |
|---|---|---|
| `COUNT(*)` | clip per-PU row count (join: `dp_count_bound`), Laplace | per-lane count, median/mean of 64 |
| `COUNT(DISTINCT x)` | per-PU distinct count, clip, sum, Laplace | dedicated per-lane distinct path (bit-mask of distinct values per lane), median/mean |
| `SUM(x)` | clip `x` to `dp_sum_bound`, sum, Laplace | per-lane sum, median/mean |
| `AVG(x)` | decomposed → `SUM(clip x)` + `COUNT`; released as `noised_sum / max(noised_count, 1)` (Google bounded-mean shape) | **two estimators** (`dp_sass_avg_method`): `lane_average` (default) = median/mean of the 64 per-lane averages; `ratio` = two independent SAA mechanisms for SUM and COUNT, released as `noised_sum / noised_count` |
| `MIN(x)` / `MAX(x)` | **`dp_standard`: supported** — values clipped to the public domain `[dp_minmax_lower_bound, dp_minmax_upper_bound]`, global sensitivity = range `U−L` (`×C_u` grouped), `Laplace`, output clamped back into the domain. `dp_elastic`: unsupported (elastic sensitivity is defined only for counting queries) | per-lane min/max, median/mean; empty-lane identity = Λ (min) / L (max) |

**AVG estimators (`dp_sass`).** `lane_average` is the NRS/GUPT sample-and-aggregate of the
mean (median/mean of the per-lane averages). `ratio` decomposes `AVG` into `SUM`+`COUNT`,
privatises each with its own SAA mechanism (each gets `ε/2`, `δ/2` of the AVG cell), and
releases the ratio clamped into `[dp_sass_avg_lower_bound, dp_sass_avg_upper_bound]` — the
Google-DP bounded-mean shape (reuses the Laplace modes' `RewriteAvgAggregates` +
`WrapAvgRatioProjection`). Both satisfy DP; the flag exists to compare utility (§16).

Aggregate `FILTER (WHERE …)` is folded into the value (`CASE WHEN cond THEN x END`) rather
than kept as a separate filter, so it survives the per-PU rewrite (`FoldFilterIntoValue`).

**Implicit FK paths.** A `dp_sass` query over a `PRIVACY_LINK` table that never names the
PU table (e.g. `SELECT SUM(v) FROM events`) is fully supported: the stable sample lanes
are built from the PU-adjacent table's FK column, so a PU's many rows share the same
lane, matching the explicit-join result — the same way `dp_standard`
derives the PU key from the FK column.

**`COUNT(DISTINCT)` in `dp_sass` (low level).** `RewriteDistinctCountToSampleMedian`
builds a three-stage plan. (1) An **inner aggregate** groups by `[groups…, PU, distinct
value]` and computes `bit_or(dp_sample_mask(pu_hash))` — `dp_sample_mask` maps the PU to
its lane bitmask, so each distinct `(group, PU, value)` row records *which of the 64
lanes that PU occupies*. (2) The **contribution caps** above it (the two `BuildRankCapFilter`
windows from §8) bound each PU to `C_u` groups and `dp_count_bound` distinct values per
`(PU, group)`. (3) A **merge aggregate** groups by `[groups…, distinct value]` and
`bit_or`s the per-PU masks, yielding, for each distinct value, the set of lanes in which
it appeared; the terminal then counts distinct values per lane (a popcount across the 64
bits) to get 64 lane counts, and releases their median/mean. Per-lane distinct counting
is thus a `bit_or`-of-lane-masks reduction, not 64 separate `COUNT(DISTINCT)`s.

---

## 14. NULL handling

### Empty-lane filling (`dp_sass`)

A `dp_sass` aggregate computes 64 lane answers and releases the median (or mean) of
those 64. Some lanes can be **empty** — no PU was assigned to that lane, or everything
in it was filtered out. An empty lane has no natural answer: an empty `COUNT`/`SUM` is
`0`, but an empty `AVG`/`MIN`/`MAX` is undefined (`NULL`, i.e. ±∞).

The danger is that the *number* of non-empty lanes is **data-dependent** — a group with
3 PUs populates far fewer of the 64 lanes than a group with 3000. If we released "the
median over just the non-empty lanes," that effective sample size would itself be a
signal about the group's support, and it is not covered by the noise calibration — a
leak.

So instead of dropping empty lanes, every empty lane is filled with a fixed **public**
constant, chosen per aggregate kind from the admin-set output domain `[L, Λ]` (§4) and
**never from the data**:

| aggregate | empty-lane fill | rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `COUNT` | `0` | an empty subsample counts nothing |
| `SUM` | `0` | empty sum |
| `MIN` | `Λ` (public upper bound) | min of the empty set is +∞ → clamp to the top of the domain |
| `MAX` | `L` (public lower bound) | max of the empty set is −∞ → clamp to the bottom of the domain |
| `AVG` | midpoint `(L+Λ)/2` | neutral in-range value |

Because the fill depends only on the public bounds (`dp_sass_count_output_bound`,
`dp_sass_minmax_lower/upper_bound`, …), swapping one PU in or out cannot change what an
empty lane receives — it leaks nothing. Were the fill taken from the data (e.g. the
observed minimum) it *would* leak, which is why §5 lists "empty-lane fill is public" as
a load-bearing assumption. The effect: a 3-PU group and a 3000-PU group both yield 64
fully-defined lanes, so the support signal never reaches the released median. This is
the GUPT "fixed number of blocks, bounded block outputs" property.

### Other NULL cases

- **Suppressed groups** (noised `η' < τ`, §7) are **dropped** from the result — they
  do not appear as NULL rows.
- **SQL NULLs in the data** follow normal aggregate semantics (e.g. `SUM` skips NULL
  inputs) before clipping/sampling.
- A **legacy unbounded** median path still returns NULL when fewer than 32 lanes are
  valid; it is not reachable from the compiler (which always supplies bounds) and is
  kept only for the raw scalar function.

```

The hook runs **before** DuckDB's optimizers, so filters are still separate `FILTER`
nodes and `LIMIT` is a separate root; `ResolveOperatorTypes()` must be called before
reading projection types. Noise is added by the `dp_noise` scalar / the sample-median
terminals; a non-finite noise scale (sensitivity/ε overflow) **throws** rather than
releasing the raw value; `privacy_noise = false` zeroes noise for deterministic tests.

## 16. Open questions and resolutions

### Resolved

- **`N_PU` public (`δ = 1/N_PU`).** Accepted: revealing `N_PU` is fine in the current
  model. Keep `δ = 1/N_PU` derived from a *public* estimate of the dataset scale, not the
  exact private PU count.
- **AVG estimator.** Both are now implemented and selectable via `dp_sass_avg_method`
  (§13): `lane_average` (NRS/GUPT sample-and-aggregate of the mean) and `ratio` (two
  independent SAA mechanisms for SUM/COUNT, released as their clamped ratio — the
  Google-DP shape). Both satisfy DP; which gives better utility is the empirical
  comparison the flag enables.
- **MIN/MAX under the Laplace modes.** `dp_standard` now supports MIN/MAX via bounded
  global sensitivity (`U−L` over the public `[dp_minmax_lower_bound, dp_minmax_upper_bound]`
  domain, `×C_u` grouped, output clamped) — confirmed sound and expected to give better
  utility than `dp_sass`'s median-of-lane-extrema; Google DP supports them too.
  `dp_elastic` still cannot (elastic sensitivity is defined only for counting queries).
- **Implicit FK paths in `dp_sass`.** Previously `dp_sass` silently returned garbage for a
  query that never named the PU table; now the lanes are derived from the linked table's
  FK column and the result matches the
  explicit join (§13).

### Still open

1. **`sample_lanes > 1` smooth sensitivity.** Overlapping subsamples change the analysis: a
   PU may influence several lanes. We use a **hard cap** of `sample_lanes` (`DpSampleHash`
   sets ≤ `sample_lanes` bits) and charge `beta_eff = β/sample_lanes`; this differs from a
   Bernoulli-`1/m` inclusion model, under which a PU appears in up to O(√m) subsamples
   (Nissim et al.) and that factor must enter the analysis. Confirm our hard-cap scaling is
   sound, or restrict `sample_lanes > 1`. (Dandan offered pseudocode for this case.)
2. **Configurable `m`.** `m` is fixed at 64 (SIMD/perf). SAA supports general `m`; `m ≤ 64`
   is achievable by using a subset of the 64-bit mask, `m > 64` needs a wider multi-word
   representation. Worth exposing `m` as a setting (64 the recommended default) — future work.
3. **τ under very small δ.** A very small `δ_η` drives τ large enough to suppress all
   groups. Possible mitigation (Dandan): give partition selection a relatively larger
   `δ_η` (an uneven δ split) so τ stays practical. Currently `δ_η = δ/(c+1)` (even split).
4. **User-level FLEX.** Extending `dp_elastic` from row-level to user-level needs new
   per-user statistics + a sensitivity analysis and proof (future work).
5. **`FILTER` on `COUNT(DISTINCT)`** (§3) — implementation gap, not a DP restriction: the
   distinct rewrite already uses the aggregate's `FILTER` slot, so a user `FILTER` would
   have to be composed with it. Fails closed for now; plain aggregates support `FILTER`.
6. **Fail-open side tables** — an unannotated private table is treated as public (§5.6);
   this relies on analyst discipline.
